    "Databases impact our everyday lives in some shape or form (often without us even being aware of it). Take coffee, as an example. Each time you buy a pumpkin spice latte, you scan your rewards card and earn rewards points that you can redeem later towards the purchase of more lattes. All of that purchase and rewards information then gets stored in a database. Fortunately, SQL can help us rapidly navigate these databases - query, retrieve, and aggregate millions of records to gain insights. SQL programming can be used to insert, search, update, and delete database records. It can also do things such as optimize and maintain databases. Even with the expansion of \"Not Only SQL\" or [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) databases, there's still no need to become unnecessarily distracted by the shiny, new-fangled, NoSQL red button just yet. Traditional, relational databases are cornerstones of data ecosystems, making SQL the most popular standard query language to access data. When you are able to understand SQL and use it effectively, you will be able to harness even more powerful features and technologies in the data industry.\n",

    "The goal of this project is to provide a Complete Guide to the intermediate hacking skills needed to aggregate data across entire columns or merge multiple datasets together with SQL. The project makes use of the [Bay Area Bike Share](https://mtc.ca.gov/our-work/operate-coordinate/traveler-services/bay-area-bike-share) data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share). The Bay Area Bike Share program enables quick, easy, and affordable bike trips around the San Francisco Bay Area. The original dataset contains data for 70 stations (where users can pickup or return bikes), about 71M status updates (number of bikes and docks available for given station), about 670k trips (individual bike trips), and about 3k weather forecasts (for a specific day for a certain zip code). \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to SQL databases, transactional tables are large and updated frequently, whereas reference tables are smaller and rarely modified. The `station` table used in this guide is a reference table, as each row represents a single bike station with associated information for that bike station. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some additional information about the `station` table:\n",
    "* `id` is a primary key (unique identifier for each row)\n",
    "* `name` is the official name of each bike station\n",
    "* `lat` is the latitude coordinates of the bike station\n",

    "* `city` is the name of the city where the bike station is located\n",
    "* `installation_date` is the date the bike station was installed\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the `trip` table used in this guide is a transactional table, as each row represents a single bike trip with associated information for that bike station. As you can imagine, a user might take multiple bike trips in a single day from a single bike station.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some additional information about the `trip` table:\n",
    "* `id` is a primary key (unique identifier for each row)\n",

    "* `start_date` is the starting time stamp of the trip in 'MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm' format\n",
    "* `start_station_name` is the name of the bike station where the trip started\n",
    "* `start_station_id` is the foreign key (unique identifier of station) for the starting station \n",
    "* `end_date` is the ending time stamp of the trip in 'MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm' format\n",
    "* `end_station_name` is the name of the bike station where the trip ended \n",
    "* `end_station_id` is the foreign key (unique identifier of station) for the ending station\n",
    "* `bike_id` is the foreign key (unique identifier of each bike) for bikes in the system \n",
    "* `subscription_type` is the type of user ('Subscriber' or 'Customer') \n",
    "* `zip_code` is the zip code of the start_station\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the `weather` table used in this guide is also a transactional table, as each row represents the weather information for a single day, observed at a specific zip code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some additional information about the `weather` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `date` is the date of measurement in 'MM/DD/YYYY' format\n",
    "* `max_temperature_f` is the highest temperature on a given day in Fahrenheit\n",
    "* `mean_temperature_f` is the average temperature on a given day in Fahrenheit \t\n",
    "* `min_temperature_f` is the lowest temperature on a given day in Fahrenheit \t\n",
    "* `max_dew_point_f` is the highest temperature when air saturated with water vapor on a given day in Fahrenheit\n",
    "* `mean_dew_point_f` is the average temperature when air is saturated with water vapor on a given day in Fahrenheit\n",
    "* `min_dew_point_f` is the lowest temperature when air is saturated with water vapor on a given day in Fahrenheit\n",
    "* `max_humidity` is the highest grams of water vapor per kilogram of air on a given day\n",
    "* `mean_humidity` is the average grams of water vapor per kilogram of air on a given day\n",

    "If you skipped the [Beginner's Guide to Basic SQL](https://www.bingyune.com/blog/bike-share-basic-sql), we encourage you to take a quick peek at this page to get an idea of how to use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to get the most out of this guide. For your convenience, here's the gist:\n",

Keep in mind that the answers to practice problems should be used as a reference, but are by no means the only ways of answering the questions. Here are a few ways to validate your query results:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check that the table and column names are correct\n",
    "* Check that your single quotes ( `‘` ) or double quotes ( `“` ) are closed\n",

    "* Review error messages when your query does not run\n",

It's important to remember that aggregations only aggregate vertically in a particular column. A few valuable SQL clauses that are often used with aggregations are `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`. \n",
    "* `MIN` returns the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as close alphabetically to \"A\" as possible\n",
    "* `MAX` returns the highest number, latest date, or non-numerical value as close alphabetically to \"Z\" as possible\n",
    "* `SUM` adds together all the values in a particular column (think addition of numbers in math)\n",

In such cases, duplicate elements are filtered before being passed into the aggregate function.

    "## 3.1 SQL GROUP BY\n",
    "\n",
    "`GROUP BY` indicates the dimensions you want to group your data by (e.g. a category to sort into subgroups)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also group by multiple columns similar to using `SELECT` or `ORDER BY`. Note that whenever you select multiple columns, they must be separated by commas, but you should **not** include a comma after the last column name. There are a few others things to be aware of as you group data by multiple columns: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The order of column names in your `GROUP BY` clause doesn't affect the order of your results. You must use the `ORDER BY` clause to control the order of how aggregations are grouped together. \n",
    "2. SQL evaluates the aggregations before the `LIMIT` clause. In other words, if you group by a column or multiple columns with enough unique values that it exceeds the `LIMIT` number, the aggregates will be calculated, and then some rows will simply be omitted from the query result.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to SQL standard, the `SELECT` clause may only contain columns mentioned in the `GROUP BY` and expressions based on aggregate functions. The primary reason for this requirement is ambiguity - `GROUP BY` produces a single record for each group of records. In other words, `GROUP BY` columns contain the same value for all records in the group and any aggregate function produces a single value for a group. In many instances of SQL, you would get the following error message when using the `GROUP BY` clause incorrectly:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ERROR: column \"some_table.column_name\" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, SQLite handles such a situation in a different way. If the column is used in an aggregate function, the aggregation is evaluated across all rows in the group as normal. Otherwise, the column is evaluated against **a single arbitrarily chosen row** from within the group. If there is more than one non-aggregate column in the result-set, then all such columns are evaluated in a similar way for the same row. We recommend you do not use `GROUP BY` in this manner because it produces unpredictable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's happening in the below query? In this case, the query is telling the database to return `start_station_name` and sum of `duration` as columns from the table `trip` in the database `database.sqlite`. The sum of `duration` is a aggregation of the `duration` column. When you run this query, you'll get back a set of results that shows values for total `duration`, grouped by `start_station_name`, and sorted in order from longest to shortest total `duration` for the first 10 results.

    "So what's happening in the below query? In this case, the query is telling the database to return `start_station_name` and average of `duration` columns from the table `trip` in the database `database.sqlite`, where the value for `AVG(duration)` is greater than 1 hour (3600 seconds). When you run this query, you'll get back a set of results that shows values in each of these columns with an applied filter after the aggregation. Similar to `WHERE`, if you write a `HAVING` clause that filters based on values in one column, you'll limit the results in all columns to rows that satisfy the condition. The idea is that each row is one data point or observation, and all the information contained in that row belongs together."

    "The `CASE` expression is a SQL way of handling the common if-then-else statements seen in other programming languages - if a hypothesis is TRUE, then a conclusion will occur, else a different conclusion will occur. The `CASE` expression is followed by at least one pair of `WHEN` and `THEN` expressions. Every `CASE` expression must end with the `END` expression. The `ELSE` expression is optional, and provides a way to capture values not specified in the `WHEN`/`THEN` expression. You can use the `CASE` expression in any clause or statement that accepts a valid expression such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`.\n",

In this case, the query is telling the database to return a new column `city_nickname` that is created from the original `city` column, from the table `station` in the database `database.sqlite`. When you run this query, you'll get back a values for each row in the new column `city_nickname`, based on expressions using values in the original `city` column."

    "# 4. SQL UNIONs and JOINs\n",
    "\n",
    "We've only been working with one table at a time so far. However, the real power of SQL comes from working with data from multiple tables at once. A SQL database is also called a \"relational database\" because the tables within the database \"relate\" to one another through common unique identifiers (keys). The relationship between tables allows information from multiple tables to be combined easily in SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to combining information from multiple tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "`UNION` merges rows of *similar* data to create a new set, essentially stacking one table on top of another. Note that `UNION` only appends distinct values. In other words, when you use `UNION`, the dataset is appended, and any rows in the appended table that are exactly identical to rows in the first table are dropped. If you'd like to append all the values from the second table, use `UNION ALL`. You'll likely use `UNION ALL` far more often than `UNION`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`JOIN` combines columns from tables using common unique identifiers (keys). The first table introduced from the database `database.sqlite` - the `station` table - contains bike station information, and has one row for each bike station. The second table - the `trip` table - contains trip information, where each row represents a completed trip. The `trip` table includes the `start_station_id` and `end_station_id`, which are unique identifiers (keys) of the station where trips started and ended, respectively. By matching - or joining - the `start_station_id` in the `trip` table to the `id` in the `station` table, we can connect more detailed bike station information to every trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `UNION`s and/or `JOIN`s in SQL, it's often easiest to give your table names (and columns) aliases. For example the `station` table is not that long of a name, but it can still be shortened to `s` for simplicity. You can give a table (or a column) an alias in one of two ways: 1) by adding a space after the table (or column) name and typing the intended name of the alias; or 2) by adding a space after the table (or column) name, typing the `AS` keyword, and then typing the intended name of the alias. The best practice for aliases is to use all lowercase letters and underscores instead of spaces. Once you've given a table an alias for instance, you can refer to columns in that table in the `SELECT` clause using the alias name. On a final note about aliases, SQL can identify unique column names between different tables, so it's optional to use aliases when referencing columns that exist in only one of the tables (no ambiguity)."

    "## 4.1 SQL UNION\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of `UNION`s: 1) a **table** `UNION` includes selections from different tables; 2) a **column** `UNION` is when you `UNION` columns from the same table together; and 3) a **combination** of *column* and *table* `UNION`s brings together specific columns from different tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's happening in the below query? In this case, the query is telling the database to return the `zip_code` column from the table `weather` and the `zip_code` column from the table `trip` in the database `database.sqlite`. When you run this query, you'll get back all the unique zip codes from the `weather` table and the unique zip codes from the `trip` table. Note the first column selected is w.zip_code. Because of the alias, this is equivalent to pubic.weather.zip_code: we're selecting the zip_code column in the `weather` table in `sqlite_schema` schema (default schema table in SQLite)."

    "`INNER JOIN` creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (`table_a` and `table_b`) based upon the common unique identifiers (keys). The `ON` keyword indicates how the two tables (the one after the `FROM` and the one after the `INNER JOIN`) relate to each other through the \"mapping\" of columns. The two columns that map to one another, are referred to as \"foreign keys\" or \"join keys.\" Their mapping is written as a conditional expression with the `=` sign. The query compares each row of `table_a` with each row of `table_b` to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the conditional expression. When the conditional expression is satisfied, the column values for each matched pair of rows from `table_a` and `table_b` are combined into a result row.\n",

    "*Syntax:* `SELECT ... FROM table_a FULL OUTER JOIN table_b ON conditional_expression ...`\n",

    "`FULL OUTER JOIN` or `FULL JOIN` will return all of the records from both tables, joining records from the left table (`table_a`) that match records from the right table (`table_b`). It is commonly used in conjunction with aggregations to understand the amount of overlap between two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, the result of the `FULL OUTER JOIN` is a combination of  a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN`. Because SQLilte does not support the `RIGHT JOIN` clause, we use the `LEFT JOIN` clause in a second `SELECT` statement instead and switch the positions of `table_a` and `table_b`. Add a `UNION ALL` clause to retain the duplicate rows from the result sets of both queries. Finally, a `WHERE` clause in the second `SELECT` statement removes rows that were already included in the result set of the first `SELECT` statement.\n",

    "Congratulations, you've learned most of the technical stuff you need to know to analyze data using SQL. Despite being older than many other types of programming languages, SQL is still the most widely implemented database language. SQL can be used to explore and analyze data, particularly data that is found in relational database management systems, which include data organized into tables. Because we live in a data-driven world (with more data being generated every day), understanding SQL is a great employable skill not only for data scientists and data analysts, but for almost everyone.\n",
